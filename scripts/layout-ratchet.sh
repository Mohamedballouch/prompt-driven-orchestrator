# Layout ratchet (#494): the number of direct tracked files in each watched

# <directory>  <max direct tracked files>
# frontend/src/components: 146 reconciles a preexisting drift (the tree already
#   held 146 direct files before #598; the baseline had lagged at 144). Ratchet
#   down when the flat list is genuinely tidied.
# frontend/src/components: 157 admits the declarative provisioning editor,
#   persisted-scope host, and component test. Provisioning is a new concern shared
#   by four existing surfaces, so one reusable sibling avoids divergent editors.
# crates/pdo-daemon/src: 75 admits the provisioning resolver/provisioner sibling;
#   it owns matching, persistence, preview, and filesystem effects at one seam.
#   71 admitted three pure Performance modules from #585:
#   context_peak.rs parses harness telemetry, distribution.rs owns R-7 summary
#   statistics, and stats_performance.rs aggregates the HTTP response. Keeping
#   these concerns separate follows the sibling-module rule. 68 previously
#   admitted the three pure modules from the `copilot` spec (#612).
# frontend/src/components: 185 and crates/pdo-daemon/src: 83 reconcile a drift
#   already present on main (the CI ratchet is red there since the run behind
#   #718); #722 adds no top-level file to either directory, the flat counts are
#   re-admitted as-is to green the gate again. Ratchet down when tidied.
# frontend/src/components: 188 and crates/pdo-daemon/src: 87 (#750) — 188 re-admits
#   three top-level components that landed on main after the previous reconcile
#   (the review UI itself lives under components/review/, not counted); 87 admits
#   review_comments.rs, the review-comment concern (ids, excerpt, batch message,
#   projection fold — ADR-0067 §2). Ratchet down when tidied.
# frontend/src/components: 190 re-admits ThemeSelect.tsx and its test (#767, light
#   theme), which landed on main past the 188 baseline and left the gate red. Ratchet
#   down when tidied.
# frontend/src/components: 191 admits OrchestrationTab.test.tsx (#783) — the tab
#   and its shared pastilles had no component test; the stale pill needed one.
# frontend/src/components: 194 (#802) admits SourceBranchField.tsx and its test, and
#   re-admits one file that landed on main past the previous baseline. The field is
#   ONE new concern — choosing a source branch and seeing its freshness — and it is
#   deliberately one sibling rather than two (quick pick + sync button): the primary
#   field and every secondary row use the same component, which is the only thing
#   that keeps them from drifting the way #571 documented. Its pure logic went into
#   the EXISTING lib/branchSelect.ts, and its fetch/race rules into hooks/ (neither
#   is a watched directory), so nothing that could live in a sibling opened a file.
# crates/pdo-daemon/src: 90 reconciles a drift already present on main (the CI
#   ratchet was red there before #802). #802 itself adds NO daemon file: the fetch
#   verb, the enriched branch list and their tests all folded into lib.rs beside
#   `list_branches`, which already owned the concern. Ratchet down when tidied.
# crates/pdo-daemon/src: 91 (#824, release 1.97.0) admits repo_scaffold.rs — the generic
#   "create a git repository from scratch" verb the *First run* tour calls for its
#   training repo. It is ONE new concern with three outcomes and no existing sibling
#   owns it (worktree/branch modules operate on an existing repo, never create one);
#   folding it into lib.rs would only hide 400 lines of git plumbing there. The
#   integration PRs landed past the 90 baseline and left main red.
# frontend/src/components: 200 (#840 story, integration/840-canvas-edges). Re-admits the
#   three per-ticket component tests #843/#845 landed past 194 (EdgeDetailPanel.outputs843,
#   EdgeDetailPanel.display845, OrthogonalEdge.labels845) and admits #844's net +3:
#   NodeRimHandles.tsx replaces OutputPortDot.tsx (the rim IS the connection source now,
#   ADR-0072), WiringGridOverlay.tsx + its test draw the wiring lattice, and
#   OrthogonalEdge.wiring844 / EditCanvas.contextMenu are the FP-backing tests. The pure
#   geometry went into lib/ (anchorSide, wiringGrid), not a watched directory.
# frontend/src/components: 201 (#877, release 1.103.0) admits GridSizePicker.tsx — the S/M/L
#   wiring grid size radio group, rendered by BOTH SettingsSurface (global default) and
#   PipelineInspector (per-pipeline override, ADR-0076). One shared control rather than two
#   copies; the step arithmetic lives in lib/wiringGrid and the resolution in hooks/useWiringGrid.
# crates/pdo-daemon/src: 92 (#869, release 1.98.0) admits shared_terminal.rs — the shared
#   terminal presence registry (one pilot per tmux session, read-only spectators, role
#   messages, `ignore-size` switching; ADR-0075). It is ONE new concern that #870 (take
#   control) extends; pty_bridge.rs only moves bytes and keeps its size, lib.rs only wires it.
# frontend/src/components: 202 (#899, release 1.103.2) admits AgentProfileModal.tsx — the
#   agent profile editor moved out of AgentProfilesPanel's inline form into ONE modal shared
#   by the row's Edit button and New profile (like ProjectEditModal). The panel keeps the list.
# frontend/src/components: 203 (#890, story #888) admits StatsAbsorption.tsx and its test —
#   the multi-select bar, the Combine modal, the `[⧉ N]` pill and the members modal of a
#   Stats Absorption (ADR-0077). StatsModal/StatsCharts render it; the grouping rule lives in
#   lib/statsAbsorption and the persistence in hooks/useStatsAbsorption.
# crates/pdo-daemon/src: 93 (#890, story #888) admits stats_absorption.rs — storing
#   absorptions and folding absorbed Pipelines into their absorber across every Stats tab. It
#   is ONE concern that stats.rs and stats_performance.rs consume, as stats_performance.rs
#   already sits beside stats.rs; lib.rs only wires the routes.
# frontend/src/components: 205 (#891, story #888; 204 + #899's AgentProfileModal.tsx once
#   main merged in) admits StatsAbsorptionsPanel.tsx — the
#   Settings › General › Stats absorptions list (every absorption, its origin, uncombine as
#   you go). SettingsSurface renders it; it reuses StatsAbsorption's UncombineButton and
#   lib/statsAbsorption, so only the Settings layout is new.
# frontend/src/components: 206 (#974, story retours-2026-10-05; 204 + #971's
#   ImportFilesModal.tsx and its test once the integration merged in) admits
#   PipelineValidation.tsx and its test — the ValidationIndicator and the
#   ValidatePipelineModal of a Pipeline validated per Project, rendered by BOTH TabBar and
#   LibraryRow. The sectioning rule lives in lib/pipelineValidation.
# crates/pdo-daemon/src: 94 (UI04, docs/plans/dashboard-and-analytics.md) admits
# stats_dashboard.rs — ONE concern: the Dashboard's summary of run outcomes and
# live attention, folded from the run projection. It is neither cost (stats.rs)
# nor execution performance (stats_performance.rs), and it consumes both's
# shared identity rule (stats::project_identity_for_root) instead of copying it.
# frontend/src/components: 208 (UI05, docs/plans/dashboard-and-analytics.md) admits
# Dashboard.tsx and its test — ONE concern: the landing view of live attention,
# active work, recorded spend and recent results. Its pure logic lives in
# lib/dashboardMetrics.ts and its data in hooks/useDashboard.ts; it reuses the
# Stats cost formatting (lib/costLabel.ts) instead of a parallel analytics stack.
